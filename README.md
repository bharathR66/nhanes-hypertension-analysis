 NHANES Hypertension Risk Analysis

This project analyzes data from the NHANES 2017–18 public health survey to identify statistically significant predictors of hypertension among U.S. adults using R. We applied logistic regression, chi-square tests, and t-tests to model hypertension risk and highlight patterns in public health indicators.

##  Objectives
- Clean and explore NHANES data (~4,300 respondents)
- Perform statistical analysis and logistic regression
- Identify key predictors like age, BMI, income
- Create clear, shareable insights via PDF and HTML reports

## Files
- `Hypertension analysis.pdf`: Summary report of methods and findings  
- `Nhanes_hypertension2017.html`: Interactive HTML version (viewable in browser)

##  Tools Used
- R, dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, caret
- NHANES 2017–18 data

## Results
- Achieved 71% accuracy and 84% recall
- Age and BMI emerged as top risk factors
